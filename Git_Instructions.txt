Initial Steps:

sudo apt-get install git
git -version
cd Desktop
git clone https://github.com/rcr-software/VDS_3.0.git

Whenever you wanna upload:

cd Desktop
cd VDS_3.0
git status
git add .
git status
git commit -m "COMMENTS"  <-- Include ""
git push                  <-- Refer to NOTES    

NOTES:

After "git push" you will enter username for github as usual
but the password has to be a special access token.
Go here: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token
create token for whatever controls
Paste that token in for when it asks for password.
